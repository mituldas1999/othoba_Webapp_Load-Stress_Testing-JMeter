10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 9s; error rate~0.18% And Total Concurrent API requested: 1640.

20 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 17.2s;error rate~0.06% And Total Concurrent API requested:3280.

30 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 18s; error rate~1.09% And Total Concurrent API requested: 1470.
